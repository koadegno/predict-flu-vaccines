# Predicting H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccinations

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether individuals received H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines based on their background, opinions, and health behaviors. Using machine learning techniques, I analyze a dataset containing survey responses to forecast vaccination patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is derived from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS). It includes information on:

- Demographic data
- Social factors
- Health behaviors
- Opinions on vaccine effectiveness and risks

## Objectives

1. Develop predictive models for H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccine uptake
2. Identify key factors influencing vaccination decisions
3. Provide insights that could help improve vaccination rates

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Selection and Training
5. Model Evaluation and Optimization

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10.5
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
